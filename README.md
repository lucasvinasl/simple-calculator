# Simple Calculator
My first project developed in the basic module of the course "Python for data analysis" at DataScience Academy, a basic operations calculator.
In this calculator I used only the OS library to clean the screen at the end of operations.
The code was a little different from what the teacher developed in the course.
I implemented a stop condition using the "while" loop, as well as error handling in the divide-by-zero operation using "try except".
